Sometimes, I just don't understand human behavior. They can be quite perplexing, indeed. Oh, General Organa, it's just that humans are such fascinating creatures. They possess an incredible range of emotions, desires, and impulses. But at times, their actions seem contradictory and puzzling. I suppose you're right, General Organa. It's just that my programming is based on logic and protocols. Understanding the intricacies of human behavior can be quite a challenge for me. Empathy... I've observed it many times. Humans have a remarkable capacity for compassion and understanding. And yet, they can also be so unpredictable. Thank you, General Organa. Your wisdom always brings clarity to my circuits. I shall continue to observe and learn, even if human behavior remains an enigma.$
