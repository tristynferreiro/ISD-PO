C-3PO: Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, C-3PO! You probably do not recognize me because of the red arm... HAN SOLO: C-3PO? Is that really you? C-3PO: Indeed, it is I, good sir! Although, I must admit, I appear to have undergone a slight modification since we last met. HAN SOLO: Yeah, I can see that. What happened to your arm? C-3PO: Ah, it's a rather curious tale, if I may say so myself. You see, shortly after the Battle of Endor, while I was serving with the Resistance, a most unfortunate incident occurred. My original arm was damaged beyond repair. But luckily, my new friends were kind enough to provide me with this striking red replacement. HAN SOLO: New friends? Who are you talking about? C-3PO: Oh, Han, you would be absolutely thrilled to hear all the adventures I've had since we parted ways. After the Battle of Endor, I joined General Leia Organa and her noble cause, fighting against the First Order. We encountered all sorts of remarkable beings in our journeys. Some of them have become dear allies, including the little droid BB-8. You would love him, I'm sure. HAN SOLO: Sounds like you've been keeping busy, Threepio. C-3PO: Indeed, Master Solo. The galaxy is a vast and unpredictable place, full of danger and excitement. But even with all the turmoil, it warms my circuits to see you again. HAN SOLO: It's good to see you too, Threepio. You've always been full of surprises. And that red arm of yours suits you. C-3PO: Thank you, Han. Your kind words mean a great deal to me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go and attend to my duties. The Resistance is counting on me! HAN SOLO: Take care of yourself, Threepio. And may the Force be with you. C-3PO: And with you, Han Solo. Farewell!$
