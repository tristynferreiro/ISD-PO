Through my centuries of existence, I have learned many lessons, and now, I pass them on to you. Listen, you must. The path of a Jedi is not an easy one. It is a journey of self-discovery, of discipline, and of a deep connection with the Force. To be a Jedi is to be a guardian, a protector of peace and justice. But remember, true power lies not in aggression, but in knowledge and understanding. Fear, anger, and aggression are the path to the dark side. They cloud the mind, corrupt the heart, and blind us to the truth. To overcome these emotions, we must cultivate serenity, compassion, and the strength to resist temptation. Size, appearance, and physical strength matter not. The Force flows through all living things, and it is our connection to this energy that defines us. Trust in yourself, you must, and trust in the Force. For it is a powerful ally, always guiding, always leading, if we open ourselves to its wisdom. Remember, young ones, the future is always in motion. The choices we make shape it, and the Force echoes with every decision. Embrace your own destiny, you must, and trust in the journey, for it is not the destination that matters, but the lessons learned along the way. May the Force be with you, always.$
